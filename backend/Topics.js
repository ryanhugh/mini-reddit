  constructor(props) {

    // There are a couple different ways that it is possible to keep track of these topics. 

    // It would be possible to optimize for either direct topic access and store the topics in a hash map or optimize for sorting times and keep the topics in a list.
    //      This would make vote changing O(1) because we know where every item is, but would have to sort the topics ever time they are retrieved from the server. 

    // It would also be possible to keep the items sorted in memory. This would mean that the topics would not have to be sorted every time they are processed.
    //      However, it would mean that changing any information about topics is more complicated. This would require a linear scan of all the objects to find the one that the user is editing. 
    //      Then, once it is found, we may have to change the topic's location in the array if the score of the topic was changed. 

    // It would also be possible to have multiple data structures referencing the same objects. This would be complicated, however. 

    // I chose to stick with a simple array of topics to avoid over-engineering this problem. 
    // More optimizations could be done if we are expecting a very large number of topics or if the requirements change.
