Submittion for the Carousell codeing challenge

# Credits

Many files (a large chunk of server.js, the webpack config, index.html, index.js, package.json) were copied from another Node.js project of mine, [Search NEU](https://github.com/ryanhugh/searchneu). I made some changes to some of these files for this project. All the files inside the \_\_snapshots\_\_ directory were generated automatically by Jest. The SVG files were downloaded from the internet (https://www.iconfinder.com/search/?q=arrow). All the other files were written for this project.
